#redistricting

This repo contains code/data for the paper "A Political Redistricting Algorithm with Communities of Interest" by Benjamin Tengelsen and Ryan Murray. The paper proposes a new algorithm for drawing district boundaries. The algorithm is an adaptation of previous methods which minimize transport distances between constituents and representatives. The crucial adaptation is a modification in the distance metric which permits the algorithm to respect communities of interest. The problem is also rendered computationally tractable by some very recent regularizing methods. The repo also contains all of our results (i.e. maps, and the paper itself). 

The code is written in python and aims to be tidy/readable so that anyone can use and adapt the code for their respective state.
