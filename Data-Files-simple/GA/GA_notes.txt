For Georgia, we have boundary file for 2008 with associated data, and Steve has imported 2006.  

I made some changes to stata version of Steve file in order to facilitate the merge.

use "C:\Users\jrodden\Dropbox\Sloan\GA\VTD08-Shape\vtd08.dta", clear

joinby county_nam precinct_name_08 using "C:\Users\jrodden\Dropbox\Sloan\GA\VTD08-Shape\ga_steve.dta", unmatched(both)

drop area- unknown_vo

save "C:\Users\jrodden\Dropbox\Sloan\GA\VTD08-Shape\ga_merged.dta"

Next, open the shapefile for 2008, and join based on the variable "id."

Then export this.

From the resulting dbf, use stat transfer to genereate an excel file.
