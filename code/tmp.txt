Auction algorithm:

normalize rows of transportation plan
list each column in decreasing order
Add precincts iteratively (district with least current population gets to pick highest on its list that is left)
Districts add until some threshold is reached (average*(1.01))
Then just add argmax of whatever is left over


Also, remove counties that have population greater than 1/3 of the average district size

Finally, explore VTD divisions. Aggregate after removing VTD ## or PCT ## or PCT ##?
